# Web service course
This repo contains codes & notes from the Web Services course i learned at my University of Applied Sciences 
from 1.3.2019 - 1.5.2019

## Summary
The course i learned is quite long but got compressed in only 2 months time, not to mention the fact that 
some contents i found to be deprecated (XML-RPC). Furthermore, my knowledge in Java intricacies, Spring framework 
and software design are lacking (i just moved away from Game Development because i was burnt out, couldn't
handle the pressure & make lots of delays which slow down the whole team schedule).

This repo is a new project, a fresh start where i'm gonna specify problem requirements, code the solutions & document what
i've learned during the course. I'm not gonna write spaghetti code only to pass the class. Instead, i'm gonna 
try to take this opportunity to learn as much as possible, try to research & write "best practices" code. For 
the deprecated part, i'll use this chance to hone my adaptability skills.

**TL;DR** Minimal knowledges of Java, Spring, Web/Enterprise development. Trying to get back on track by learning 
as much as possible through this course to get an internship.
